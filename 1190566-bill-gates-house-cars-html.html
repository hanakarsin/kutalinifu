Mr Gates spent seven years and 63 million US dollars on his property. The mansion is called Xanadu 2.0. The palace covers more than 6 thousand square meters. The house is huge and, of course, stuffed with all sorts of high-tech innovations.</p><p class=align-left>More than 1000 cubic meters of timber products from the 500-year-old Californian fir were used. Over three hundred builders worked on the house. There were one hundred electricians among them.</p><p class=align-left>The Bill Gates house was designed by a certain James Cutler. He is the most famous architect working in the northwest of the USA. "Pacific shelter" is the main concept of the residence. What does it mean?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/db140c3ab74a2541.jpg><p class=align-left>The Gates residence’s photos are private property and protected from copyrighting. There are only images of the house’s outer part and site. And the information about the mansion is very limited. But we still share some interesting facts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5f75886c290d9f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Facts you didn’t know about the top 10 most expensive cars in the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A hi-tech sensory device assists the guests of Mr Gates to check the temperature and light in the room. Guests receive a device for the sensors’ control throughout the house. Thanks to the hidden dynamics, guests can be accompanied with the music walking from one room to another.</p><p class=align-left>The Xanadu 2.0 palace is made in such a way that the environment helps to regulate the temperature effectively.</p><p class=align-left>The work of art can be changed at the touch of a button. Computer displays that are located throughout the house with 80 thousand US dollars value show any picture or photo. Data is stored on devices with a total cost of 150 thousand US dollars.</p><p class=align-left>The swimming pool has its submarine music device. It is placed in a special construction with an area of 1200 square meters. A person can swim under a glass wall and go outside on the terrace. The house also has a cloakroom with four showers and two bathrooms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6def9b38b37bcc5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 richest pastors in the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The house has a room with a trampoline and 6-meter ceiling. True to say, we don’t know how large the trampoline is. But it's nicer and more fun than boring physical training. By the way, in the palace, there is also a room for sports with an area of 762 square meters. It contains a sauna, steam room and separate locker rooms.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Wizkid new house in Los Angeles</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4iek85q7pgh.jpg><p class=align-left>The hall for receiving the guests is huge and can accommodate up to 200 people. In the hall of 700 square meters, there are 150 seats for dinner and about 200 standing places for a cocktail party.</p><p class=align-left>There are 24 bathrooms in the house. Ten of them are full bathrooms. Bill Gates mansion has six kitchens. They are situated in different parts of the house. The staff can be ready absolutely for any event.</p><p class=align-left>There is an ancient manuscript in Bill Gate's library. Bill Gates reportedly paid more than 30 million US dollars for it. The library has a domed roof and two secret lockers. One of them includes a bar. A quote from the novel "The Great Gatsby" is written on the ceiling: <i>"The way leading him to these velvety lawns was long, and he probably seemed that now his dream was so close. It is worthwhile to reach out, and he will catch it."</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7nc2cjrt4pq.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much is Salman Khan worth?

Bill Gates purchased the manuscript for 30.8 million dollars in 1994. The home cinema with comfortable plush seats can accommodate up to 20 people.</p><p class=align-left>The former house which used to stand on the territory of the current estate had to be moved on a barge to make way for a new multi functional mansion.</p><p class=align-left>The guest house is equipped with the same high-tech gadgets as the main house. Moreover, it was built before the main one for the technology testing.</p><p class=align-left>In total, 23 cars are parked in the mansion’s garages. The garages are located in different parts of the estate. One of them looks like an underground cave made of concrete and stainless steel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5f75886c290d9f2.jpg><p class=align-left>Bill Gates has a favourite tree. He takes care of it 24 hours a day. People say that Gates is very attached to the 40-year-old maple, which grows on the road side near the house. Computers watch the tree. If it does not have enough water, then watering turns on automatically.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3g9v4f4jrmq.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most expensive in Lekki: who owns it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, there is an artificial creek on the estate. The creek and pond were created to solve problems with drains. Every year the sand from the Caribbean islands (Saint Lucia) is delivered to the mansion’s beach.</p><p class=align-left>Microsoft annually holds an auction, where employees display their products and services. The proceeds go to the charity fund of the company. One day Mr Gates auctioned a guest tour of Xanadu 2.0. According to the Puget Sound Business Journal, one of Microsoft's employees bought a tour for 35,000 US dollars.</p><p class=align-left>To date, some sources indicate that the estate’s value is 154 million US dollars, claim 250 million USD. Bill Gates reportedly bought the property in 1988 for 2 million US dollars. The famous businessman pays about 1 million US dollars as annual property tax.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How many houses did Davido have?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6def9b38b37bcc5.png><h3>Bill Gates' cars</h3><p class=align-left>Bill Gates has never concealed the fact that he is fond of cars. Mr Gates has been collecting rare specimens from all over the world as he has enough funds for this purpose.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5oubb8aju9l.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 most beautiful mansions in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When the Microsoft founder buys a car, no one is checking his solvency. Besides, it's impossible to say exactly how many cars Bill Gates has. It is known that one of the richest people in the world is very fond of the Porsche brand. For example, the Porsche 911 Turbo was exhibited for sale in 2012. The businessman bought it in 1979.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4bqed2q76d6.jpg><p class=align-left>But the most famous Gates car is Porsche 959 which he acquired in 1987. It is a headliner of his collection. The fact is that this car release was limited to 300 copies. At the same time, any deliveries of Porsche 959 to the US were not planned. They even were banned because of the requirements for vehicle safety. Nevertheless, with the help of a lawyer, Bill Gates managed to change the legislation and imported the car.</p><p class=align-left>As you can see, the famous billionaire is not fond of showing his house and cars to the public. But even so, we can observe that the mansion is huge and has everything necessary for living and entertaining guests. Besides, Mr Gates buys cars without following a fashion, but according to his taste preferences.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt697u41alss4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Davido houses: rumors and facts about his real estate</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nigerian celebrities and their houses</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKFj25tb2WSnrmtecaaq56rXZ28tr%2FEZpqaqqNjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./754209-check-full-list-winners-amvca-2016-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Check out the full list of winners at the AMVCA 2016">&larr;
