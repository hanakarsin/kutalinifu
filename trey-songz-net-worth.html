The release of his 2005 debut album “I Gotta Make It” fed the masses with soothing vocals and a unique sound with hip-hop influences. And once the hit single “Gotta Go” achieved mainstream success, Trey’s career took on a life of its own.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021, Trey is considered to be one of the most successful R&B vocalists in the game. With over 25 million records sold worldwide, a blossoming acting career, and albums that continue to perform well on the charts, Trey has established himself as a force in the entertainment world. That said, fans are wondering: What is Trey Songz’s net worth?

YOU STILL defied my wishes and in turn showed your lack of respect for a brand that took me 14 years to build and put me in the video against my wishes. Come on bruh, I clearly said no and you said okay, yet I was being secretly filmed when you told me ‘let me just show you the idea’?
