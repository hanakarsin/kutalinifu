In all my talks with Kwankwaso, I never offered him any money.”</p><p>He added that “Nobody as of today will say he’s funding Peter Obi, I’m funding myself, I don’t pay people to work for me.”</p><p>Speaking further, Obi appealed to Nigerians to ensure they vote for capable hands and not someone they would manage or who would depend on others to get things done for him as the buck ends on the table of the President.</p><p>He noted that Nigeria needs a leader that is physically and mentally sound because the demand of office is huge.</p><p>“Let nobody say we are going to manage someone who will surround himself with people that will mismanage our resources again,” the LP candidate said.</p><h2>2023 Presidency Not About Tribe Or Religion</h2><p>Obi advanced further that the 2023 presidency is not about the turn of any tribe or ethnic group as it is about Nigeria and Nigerians.</p><p>He urged citizens of the country to choose their next set of leaders based on character, competence, and capacity to deliver.</p><p>“Next year’s election will not be about the tribe. Please do not vote for Peter Obi because he is from the South-East. It is not going to be my turn but the turn of Nigeria to take back their country.</p><p>“It is not about tribe because the people in the South do not buy bread cheaper or show me where in the South-West where they have uninterrupted electricity supply or roads that are meant for South-West people only.</p><p>“Since I came to Lagos, they have been constructing Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and it has not been completed. So, it is not about the tribe. The North is more insecure than the South, so it has nothing to do with the tribe.</p><p>“It is not about religion because I don’t see where Christians buy bread cheaper than Muslims. It is the confusion of the elite to continue to impoverish the people. I’m a Nigerian and I’m contesting this election as a Nigerian. We are about 18 people contesting this election but some will be better in terms of Queens English, and some will have better certificates but remember that a certificate is not a measure of character and integrity,” he said.</p><h2>Hold Me Responsible</h2><p>The Labour Party candidate said Nigerians should hold him accountable for all the promises he is making. He added that he understands the task is enormous but his commitment is unwavering.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;“We are looking for people who will not steal our money. So, you need to examine all of us and know who to trust based on character, integrity and competence. Next year’s election will be based on character, competence, capacity and ability or commitment to start doing the right thing and I assure you that I’m committed to it.</p><p>“It is going to be difficult but it requires huge mental and physical energy. Let nobody say we are going to manage someone who will surround himself with people that will mismanage our resources again.</p><p>“I want Nigerians to hold me accountable and I will be in charge and I will drive the development. If it is security, I’m going to deal with it head-on because I will be responsible and I will make sure that I bring people who are responsive and responsible to do the work. I want to assure Nigerians that I can do this work and it has to be done. And I will not give excuses because the job of a leader is to be responsible.”</p><p>Obi further assured that he would involve women and youths in running his administration if he emerges the President of Nigeria in 2023.</p><p>“Women are more productive than men and if they decide to do something, they do it well. We will involve women and youths in my administration and channel that population into production,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FqZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5KeerS8xJqirGWfo3qotdWipaBlm6yur7fWmqqoZZ5pfaO6jK2mZqukmr1usM6wpWaen6d6qbXMaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./345425-twiga-weupe-wa-kipekee-nchini-wauawa-garissa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Twiga weupe wa kipekee nchini wauawa Garissa">&larr;
