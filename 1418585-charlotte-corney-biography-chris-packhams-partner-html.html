Her parents are named Jack and Judith Corney. She has an elder sister known as Emma.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b3a437c462a2c941.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amelia Tank's biography: what is known about Olly Murs' girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Charlotte grew up around animals as her parents owned a zoo. Her dad left his engineering job and bought <a href=#>a run-down zoo</a> in the late 1970s. He turned it around, exposing his family to the love and care for animals in the process.</p><p class=align-left>Charlotte grew up with wild animals and had intended to study animal behaviour at the university. However, she gave up her higher <a href=#>education</a> to help out at the zoo, namely to help raise a tiger.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Corney took over the operations of her parents' zoo after her dad passed on in 2003. Since then, she had been its director, managing its daily operations, rescuing animals, looking after the animals, and helping <a href=#>promote the zoo</a>. That said, in 2018, Charlotte stepped away from her position as the CEO.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b3a437c462a2c941.jpeg><p class=align-left>One of the notable works of <a href=#>promoting the zoo</a> that Corney has done is the series <i>Tiger Island</i> which was featured on the National Geographic channel. She inherited the zoo in 2013 after her mother retired as the owner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7ba4604391ae51ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Roxy Horner biography: who is Jack Whitehallâ€™s girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Isle of Wight Zoo evolved over the years, and its name was changed to <a id=https://wildheartanimalsanctuary.org/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Wildheart Animal Sanctuary</a> in 2021. Charlotte did this to show its current approach as a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rescue-first sanctuary</a> for animals who need re-homing or have been in unpleasant conditions of captivity and the like.</p><p class=align-left>Charlotte loves animals, and her work is all about protecting them and providing them with the best conditions for living. She works as an activist for wildlife conservation and animal rights. She works with different organizations on various animal-related issues.</p><p class=align-left>In 2017, Corney created The Wildheart Trust, a charity that aims to help the well-being of animals and make an impact on the <a href=#>world</a> of wildlife. It currently provides funds for conservation efforts in India, Madagascar and the UK. Charlotte's partner Chris Packham is also a Trustee.</p><h3>As Chris Packham's partner</h3><p class=align-left>Corney and Packham met at the Isle of Wight Zoo. As Chris said to her later, he knew that Charlotte was the one on the very first day they met. However, she had no such idea, as she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was in a relationship</a> with her ex-partner at the time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/1af37d858b302cbd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shipping Wars Jennifer Brennan bio: age, net worth, is she married?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chris made an effort to be with Corney, but since he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suffers from Asperger syndrome</a>, he could not directly leave her the usual signs that reveal his interest in her. However, in 2007, they were to go out for dinner but ended up talking the whole night. The two connected very deeply and soon began dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/d4270e5e96fdfe0f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Chris Packham's girlfriend would notice that he was bluntly honest and not as empathetic as she would expect. When she researched and thought that her partner might be suffering from Asperger's, she asked him about it, and he confirmed it. Chris didn't tell her about his condition for five years because he thought he was good at hiding it, but apparently, he was not that good.</p><h3>Is Chris Packham married?</h3><p class=align-left>Chris Packham and Charlotte Corney <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">are not yet married</a>. Though they have been in a relationship since 2007, they live miles apart because of work commitments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/171d4f653bd721d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lydia Bright bio: who is this reality TV star?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chris' residence is the New Forest, while Charlotte's is in the Isle of Wight. However, according to Chris Packham's wife (possibly future wife), the couple is working towards living together. For now, Corney shares her home with her pet rabbits, Abella and Otto.</p><p class=align-left>Chris was previously in a relationship with Jo McCubbin. He is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">step-dad to Jo's</a> daughter named Megan McCubbin, who has taken after him career-wise and has even appeared with him on <i>Autumnwatch</i>.
