Though she debuted as a musician in 2013, she rose to fame in 2017 with her debut album that features hits like "Be the One,", "IDGAF," and "New Rules." She has since become the recipient of numerous Grammy Awards and several accolades in British music ceremonies. She has also been featured in films like <a href=#>Barbie</a> and Argylle and even hosted <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><p>Dua continues to soar throughout her career, but the attention placed on her over the past few years has led many to wonder about her relationship history. Interestingly enough, she's been seen dating a few different guys both before and after hitting it big. Some have gone the distance while others seem like short-lived flings, and there have even been some heavy dating rumors linking her and one prominent comedic news anchor. Here's what we know about who Dua Lipa has dated in the past and present.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Isaac Carew</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Isaac Carew and Dua Lipa</p></figure><p>Sometime before Dua Lipa became ... Dua Lipa, she was dating Isaac Carew, a professional chef with over 420,000 followers on Instagram. They were with each other sporadically between 2013 and 2019. Issac was even exposed for infidelity during their romance, though they patched things up at a point. Nevertheless, they ended things more definitively once she finally hit her stride.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Paul Klein</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by paul klein (@pauljasonklein)</a></p></figure><p>In 2017, Dua Lipa went out with fellow musician Paul Klein, lead singer of a band called LANY.</p><p>Reportedly, Paul felt a deep connection with her and wasn't shy about how heartbroken he was after they split. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a> magazine, Paul admitted, "I never felt a pain like that. I'm not trying to be dramatic here. I think that was the first time I've ever been in love."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Anwar Hadid</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>One of Dua's most prominent relationships was with <a href=#>Anwar Hadid</a>, brother of Gigi and Bella Hadid. The two of them — who started dating in 2019 — were very close, thanks in no small part to their proximity to each other during the COVID-19 global quarantine. By 2021, however, they were already splitting up.</p><p>Years later, Anwar would reveal that the breakup wasn't exactly mutual. When she went public with her new boyfriend Romain (more on him in a moment) in 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that Anwar not-so-vague posted about his disdain toward her relationship status at the time.
