Scalp burn is one side effect of applying chemical hair relaxer. However, there are ways to ensure this does not happen. Some of these measures are to be taken, before, during and after application of the chemical. This is to help with itchy scalp before relaxer; scalp burn from relaxer, and scalp still burning after relaxer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdaa75725b4503f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does baking soda remove hair permanently</span></p></a><h2>What is a scalp burn?</h2><p class=align-left>Scalp burn is a burn that occurs on the scalp when chemical hair relaxer is applied and left to cook for a set period. It often begins with a tingling sensation on the scalp and advances to a more severe burn when the chemical is left to sit on the head for long. To some, these effects occur pretty quick, especially to those people with a sensitive scalp, while to others, it might take longer.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: 25 latest Ghana weaving shuku hairstyles in 2019</p><p class=align-left>Luckily, there are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">preventive measures</a> that you can take to ensure your scalp is protected from the adverse effects of chemical burn from relaxer. Here are some of them.</p><h3>1. Apply a base cream on your hairline and scalp</h3><p class=align-left>Before applying the hair relaxer, ensure that your hairdresser has applied a base cream all around the head, and the ears. If you have sensitive skin, you have to ensure that s/he applies a base on your entire scalp. S/he should use his or her fingers to apply the base cream on the hairline.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b8385516167c05f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 tips on how to use coffee for hair growth( before after pics)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some people do not like the idea of applying a base on their scalp and around the head. However, this should not stop you from doing the right thing and protecting yourself against the harsh effects of hair relaxer.</p><h3>2. Do not exercise two days before the day of the application</h3><p class=align-left>Exercising is a good way to maintain an active lifestyle. It also results in sweating, which opens up your skin pores. Open skin pores pre-exposes you to a higher likelihood of being burned during the application of a hair relaxer.</p><h3>3. Do not wash your hair before relaxing</h3><p class=align-left>It is prudent to shampoo your hair at least a week before relaxing it. This is to allow your scalp enough rest before applying the relaxer. In the same vein, do not wet or cleanse your hair before relaxing it. All of these will lead to burning.</p><p class=align-left>Do not scratch or pick your hair for it may lead to breaks which will make your scalp vulnerable to burns. You have to ensure that your scalp has every advantage it can against burns when applying the hair relaxer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/07203f456ed37c03.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to bleach hair with Clorox (hydrogen peroxide)</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdaa75725b4503f6.jpg><h3>4. Do not apply relaxer on a head with sores</h3><p class=align-left>Avoid applying hair relaxer on your head if it has sores and irritation. Wait until the scalp has healed completely before applying the relaxer. And after the application of a relaxer, refrain from scratching an itchy scalp as this might lead to wounds. Instead, rub the itchy part with a lot of care, or gently until you feel better.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: 20 best short quick weave hairstyles 2019</p><h3>5. Keep time</h3><p class=align-left>More often than not, hairdressers attend to other issues while they wait for your hair to cook well. This might distract them from your case, and in turn, lead to burns as a result of extended time. As a client, always keep track of time. And prompt your hairdresser as soon as the recommended time has elapsed. This will ensure everything goes as is supposed to.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsgh5ssk0sfk8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ways of making your natural hair curly</span></p></a><h3>6. Use a soft toothed comb</h3><p class=align-left>When combing your hair a week before the scheduled date for hair relaxing, use a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">soft toothed</a> comb. This will protect you against the possibility of breaking your scalp, which might open it up for chemical penetration.</p><p class=align-left>During the application of the hair relaxer, you should ensure that the hairdresser is not using the teeth of the comb to smooth the relaxer on your hair, for this might lead to scratching and wounding your scalp. Instead, s/he should use the back of the comb. Better yet, s/he should use their hands to spread the relaxer all over your hair.</p><h3>7. Use the right relaxer</h3><p class=align-left>You have to ensure that your hairdresser is not using just about any type of hair relaxer on you. Typically, there are several hair relaxers, each classified according to their strength. There are super, mild, and regular hair relaxers. You have to ensure that you know the type of relaxer that is best suited for you, and confirm that indeed, the hair relaxer being used by the hairdresser, is right for your hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs9kuqhm6s4ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Black men hairstyles for short hair</span></p></a><h3>8. Let your hairdresser know you</h3><p class=align-left>Before s/he can start working on you, tell the hairdresser, the type of client you are - whether sensitive or not.
