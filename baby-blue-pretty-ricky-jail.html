After the pandemic caused several businesses to shut down, the government stepped in to offer aid. But of course, news of that aid naturally came with people looking to score a quick buck.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretty Ricky</a> member <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Blue </a>(real name: Diamond Smith) is one of many people that have found themselves in trouble with the law. The rapper may have to sit down and do a prison bid, all because of greed getting the best of him.&nbsp;</p><p>So, why is Baby Blue possibly going to jail? Get comfortable as we spill all the tea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Baby Blue may be facing jail time due to taking out a fraudulent PPP loan.</h2><p>‚ÄúGet it how you live‚Äù is saying that many people live by. It basically means to get what you need without thinking about other people or the repercussions. It looks like Baby Blue was definitely applying that mantra to his life, and now he may have to pay a huge price: his freedom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In case you didn‚Äôt know, the Paycheck Protection Program (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PPP Loan</a>) was put in place as a form of emergency financial aid for business owners affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And of course, only reputable businesses are qualified to receive this aid. However, many people ‚Äî including, apparently, Baby Blue ‚Äî decided to take advantage.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, the rapper allegedly secured a $426,717 loan under the Paycheck Protection Program offered by the government for his company, Throwbackjersey.com. However, he gained this loan by submitting falsified documentation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Baby Blue was in ICU the other week, and now about to go to jail for a $24M PPP loan?!</p><p>YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS UP.</p>‚Äî k a r y. (@itsKARY_) <a href=#>May 13, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>He also took his money grab a step further by securing another PPL loan for&nbsp; $708,065 to help his other company, Blue Star Records LLC. But again, falsified documents were used to get the funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the money was turned over to the star, the spending spree began. The outlet reports that he used the money to purchase a $96,000 Ferrari among other expensive possessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention, it‚Äôs being reported that Baby Blue partnered with Tonye C. Johnson to commit the crime. As a result, the two managed to scam the government out of $24 million.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Now they are facing a slew of charges that include&nbsp;wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud ‚Äîaccording to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VladTV</u></a>. Baby Blue is now said to be facing up to five years in the big house.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Baby Blue appears to be in good spirits despite facing jail time.</h2><p>The possibility of going to prison naturally wouldn‚Äôt sit well with anyone, but Baby Blue appears to be taking the news in stride. It can be assumed that he is making most of his time before his inevitable prison bid.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>VladTV shares that the rapper is preparing to plead guilty to the charges. He is reportedly set to appear before U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke on June 9, 2021 to plead guilty to at least one federal offense.</p><p>While there has been no talk of a plea deal on the table, it‚Äôs common practice for the feds to shave off time from a participating defendant‚Äôs sentence for a guilty plea.</p><p>And despite all the drama, Baby Blue is a happy man these days. In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Unlocked</a>, the rapper shared that he is not pressed over his current legal situation ‚Äî especially since he recently was released from the hospital after being a victim of a robbery gone bad.</p><p>‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt tripping. When I get out, I'll be ripped up like Gucci Mane,‚Äù he tells the site. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôma be one of the hottest rappers in the world! My new single, 'Up Again' drops Friday! I‚Äôm talking about them f--- n----- who TRIED to rob me but ain‚Äôt get s---! Thankful to be Alive! All glory to God! Love my fans, family, and friends for sticking with a n---- through everything!
