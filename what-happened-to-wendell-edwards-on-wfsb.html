If you watch a morning news program every morning and one day discover that the anchor you've watched for years has vanished, you're going to wonder what happened to them.</p><p>Many viewers in Hartford, Conn. have noticed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendell Edwards</a>, one of the regular hosts of Eyewitness News in the Morning on WFSB in the town, is no longer in his usual role. Naturally, many want to understand what happened to Wendell.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Wendell Edwards on WFSB?</h2><p>Wendell appears to have left WFSB, although the details around his departure remain very much a mystery. According to an article published in The Laurel on Nov. 20, 2023, “His last day on the air was last Thursday, according to sources familiar with the change. Insiders say there was no explanation given to staff."</p><p>Wendell's bio has been removed from the WFSB website, but the station hasn't released any statement addressing his departure.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Wendell has also been radio silent following the reports that he was leaving the network. He has posted on Facebook once since the news broke, but only to wish his departed mother a happy birthday.</p><p>He hasn't said anything about a new job or about why he may have been fired from WFSB. For now, the circumstances around Wendell's departure from WFSB remain mostly a mystery. What's safe to say, though, is that he won't be back on the channel any time soon.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wendell has had a long career in broadcast journalism.</h2><p>Wendell first joined the WFSB team in 2021, but before that, he had a long tenure in broadcast journalism in other places across the country.</p><p>He has worked at news stations in Birmingham, Ala., and had a stint as an anchor for Hearst Television. He also worked as an anchor at Oklahoma City’s KOCO 5 News, where he received several plaudits and awards for his journalistic endeavors.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Facebook/Wendell Edwards WFSB</span></figure><p>While in Oklahoma, Wendell won two NABJ Salute to Excellence awards in 2008 and 2011. In 2010, he was awarded the Oklahoma Broadcasters Association award for outstanding investigative reporting. He is also an alumnus of Columbia Journalism School, so it's clear that his credentials weren't the reason he was fired.</p><p>Given that even most of the staff at WFSB is in the dark over the reasons for Wendell's firing, it seems distinctly possible that we may never know exactly why he was let go. Wherever he lands next, it seems likely he won't be reporting on events in Connecticut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSwnZ6Zsq24jJ6bsJmimcBuu81mrp%2Brkg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./winifer-fernandez-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Winifer Fernndez - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
