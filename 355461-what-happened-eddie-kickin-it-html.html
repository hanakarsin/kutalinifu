In 2011, a show with an unfamiliar yet exciting narrative premiered on Disney XD and created a huge fuss. At that time's standards, the show's ratings were over the roof, and it was ranked among the best. What is the show about? A young karate prodigy joins a fighting squad called the Wasabi warriors. A cool narrative, that managed to grace screens for four seasons and 84 episodes. Among the cast was, Eddie (Alex Jones), probably the sweetest and most harmless member of the group. So, why did Eddie leave "Kickin It"? Everyone was pretty sad to see the show go, and since it is around five years from its termination, many are wondering about the cast.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/c38abd6c5dfac227.jpeg><p class=align-left>The show <i>Kickin It </i>was genuinely funny, the characters, more so Eddie was warm and supportive. As the show developed, the values of teamwork, perseverance and empathy came out, perfectly woven in the storyline. And of course, it was the cast's role to depict all these emotions on screen, Eddie doing it so well.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><p class=align-left>That is why his sudden absence made people start wondering, "What happened to Eddie from <i>Kickin It</i>?" There is a lot of controversy surrounding Eddie's exit from the show some even stating that he left because he disliked his role. What is the real story, and where is the famous character now?</p><h2>What happened to Eddie from "Kickin It"? Learn the Facts</h2><p class=align-left>Are you wondering about who played Eddie in <i>Kickin It</i>? Often, Eddie was seen as the loner in the Wasabi group of the show and the fifth wheel. His character’s conflict is not fitting well in the social circle, meaning that karate meant a lot to him as a source of friends.</p><p class=align-left>That is the narrative that Alex Jones, the person playing Eddie portrayed so well. Now, Alex Jones is all grown up and not the cute character you used to watch on screen, invoking empathy and encouragement to many that find themselves facing a similar plight.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire?

Of course, some have stepped out of the spotlight and are concentrating on their lives. It is shocking how fast time flies when you look back at when the show was hot, and people started wondering where Eddie went.</p><p class=align-left>So, why did Eddie from <i>Kickin It</i> leave the show? In a sudden turn of events, Eddie Jones disappeared from the TV series after the second season. If you have watched the last episode of the second season, you will notice a kind-of preparation for his exit.</p><p class=align-left>It seems like he was kicked out of the dojo by Rudy because of his low Karate ratings. He was not as flexible as the rest of the team. However, aside from the plenty of unsubstantiated information out there, the real reason for leaving is that he was busy studying for school.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Squid Game: Top Trending Series Rejected for 10 Years before Making Netflix Splash</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, Alex wanted to put more emphasis on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">personal and family</a> life, and he left to take care of his grandparents back in Birmingham, Alabama (his birthplace).</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Brie Larson sexuality, partner, net worth, measurements, Captain Marvel petition</p><h3>Was Eddie kicked out of the show?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although there is a lot of controversy surrounding Alex’s exit from the show, the truth is he was never kicked out. The black kid on <i>Kickin It</i>, before leaving thanked the crew and the cast for having such a wonderful time. Alex announced his departure on January 2013, giving his concrete reasons for leaving it at the early stages.</p><p class=align-left>After exiting the TV series, the show's producers had to rewrite the script and come up with an entirely new version for season three where Eddie did not exist. They decided not to do any replacement, the show's cast pretending that he never existed in the first place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

When someone leaves a trending show, the narrative has to go on, and it is up to the creators to come up with a believable story to fill the gaps. Once Eddie left for personal and family reasons, the new plot had it that he left the dojo and migrated out of Seaford.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Pit Bulls and Parolees cast: real names, bios, and photos</p><h3>Almost missing an audition</h3><p class=align-left>Jones nearly missed his <i>Kickin It </i>audition.

Fortunately, Alex managed to show his talent and was hired as part of the crew.</p><h3>What is Eddie (Alex Jones) up to now?</h3><p class=align-left>Although there is sufficient information supporting Eddie’s exit from the show, many still ask What happened to Eddie from “Kickin It”?

Everything has an ending, similar to other hot show out there. After many seasons, and considering the kids are growing, the show came to an end on March 25, 2015.</p><p class=align-left>It is now nine years since the show's premiere, and of course, the majority of fans have also grown to love other material. Maybe it is was about time to give way to other more modern stories at the time and dropping the trending series was the only safe direction.</p><p class=align-left>A simple online search for Alex Jones would surprise you. Many fans pose the question, what happened to Eddie from "Kickin It"? Even though he made it clear later about his departure, many are yet to come to terms or even believe the statement considering its low-key nature.
