Though it is inspiring, or at the very least entertaining, for people watching to see contestants make a drastic physical transformation, it is probably a difficult psychological experiment to go through.</p><p>One of the most remembered examples of someone crossing a line from "health regimen" to "alleged eating disorder," was the winner of season 15, Rachel Frederickson, who won after losing 155 pounds.&nbsp;Frederickson&nbsp;went from 260 pounds to 105 pounds for&nbsp;the season finale, and the change&nbsp;was alarming. Trainer Jillian Michaels, who had worked on the show for ten years, left soon after the season ended, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her reaction</a> to Frederickson's weight loss was much discussed:&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Both Michaels and fellow trainer Bob Harper look horrified, and later blamed Frederickson's trainer, Dolvett Quince, for driving her past the point of safe weight loss for the sake of winning the competition.</p><p>Now a new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> suggests that going through The Biggest Loser challenge, and winning, may be the worst thing for long term weight loss. Led by Dr. Kevin Hall, a metabolism expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,&nbsp;the study followed what happened to the bodies of 14 contestants from Season 8.</p><p>Basically, their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">metabolisms</a> were wrecked. Most&nbsp;of them have gained their weight back, in some cases, gained even more. Most reported that their weight gain happened too quickly to be caused simply from sliding back into old habits, though it was difficult to convince people around them that something extreme had happened to change their very make-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Scientists measured chemicals in the contestants' bodies, and the number of calories those bodies burned vs. what they should&nbsp;normally be burning according the average for&nbsp;their body type. Jezebel<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breaks down</a> the discoveries:</p>When contestants began the show, their resting metabolism (meaning the number of calories they burned daily) was normal. While any dieting regimen will result in a decreased metabolism, the contestants changes were so radical that it was virtually impossible to eat so little that the body could maintain its current weight. Even more surprising was that in the six years following, their metabolisms never recovered—in fact, they became even slower.<p>Season 8’s winner, Danny Cahill, began&nbsp;the show weighing&nbsp;430 pounds and ended at 191 pounds. His was&nbsp;the biggest weight loss in the show’s history, and now, he weighs 295 pounds. According to the study's measurements, he&nbsp;burns 800 fewer calories per day than a man his size should.&nbsp;Cahill <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> The New York Times, "All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight...&nbsp;The moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, ‘This is not right. Something is wrong with my body.'"</p><p>There are detractors who warn that the sample size for the study is too small to draw any conclusions. 14 people isn't really enough to make a definitive statement on the show, or its success rate. However, if there is no underlying medical reason for your size, it seems like common sense that losing the equivalent of half your body weight, or more, in the duration of a reality TV cycle would be dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>Our society puts&nbsp;constant pressure on people to be thin, to push themselves harder, and abuse themselves in pursuit of an elusive physical perfection. Though there are likely contestants who feel positively transformed by their experience, many more are also&nbsp;discovering that the opportunity for change&nbsp;they were offered was as much of a myth as the perfection we're told&nbsp;to chase.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&amp;#xA0;</h2><p><a href=#><u>35 Passive Aggressive Neighbor Notes So Funny You Can’t Even Be Mad&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Man Expertly Trolls the DMV Every Time He Has to Update His License&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>61 Hilarious Times People Got Caught Lying on the Internet&nbsp;</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9qbWhoZWR9dHuRnKmanoZkwamxjJugoJ%2BVqMFuuM6snKurXay2r7rEq6o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./esme-mackinnon-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Esme Mackinnon - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr;
