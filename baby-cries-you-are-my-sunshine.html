He even laughs at first in order to play off that her singing the song gets him emotional. Here's how the TikTok went down:</p><p>Jillian's video begins with her rocking back and forth in a chair with the camera directed at her baby's face. Her child is resting his head against her chest. She asks the kid what he wants ‚Äî it sounds like he's asking her if she can sing, which she confirms by asking him if that's what he wants.</p><p>"You want me to sing 'Sunshine'?" she asks.</p><p>"Yeah," the child says, his hand resting on his mother.</p><p>"Are you sure?" she replies.</p><p>"Yeah," he says, seemingly pouting.</p><p>"You already look like you're about to cry," she says, acknowledging her son's pre-emotional state.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok @jillianjames31</span></figure><p>"I don't wanna sing it if you're gonna cry," she continues, before asking, "are you gonna cry?"</p><p>"No," he says, smiling into the camera.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"No," he says, smiling even more broadly as he giggles.</p><p>"What do you want? What song do you want me to sing?"</p><p>"'Sunshine'," the child says.</p><p>"You sure?" she asks again.</p><p>"Yeah," he says definitively.</p><p>"OK, you ready?" she asks as her child appears to gear himself up to listen to his mother pop off with the song, but he looks like he's already getting emotional again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok @jillianjames31</span></figure><p>James chuckles again, "Are you gonna cry? 'Cause I don't like it when you cry."</p><p>"Why?" the kid asks.</p><p>"Because it makes Mommy sad when you cry."</p><p>"Why?" he repeats, trapping her in the infinite "why" loop kids seem to love just putting their parents in.</p><p>"'Cause... I want to make you happy 'cause I'm your mama."</p><p>"Why?" the child asks as she holds him closer to her.</p><p>"'Cause I love you," she says, kissing him on his forehead. "You still want me to sing Sunshine?" she asks as a noise off-screen catches her child's attention.</p><p>"Yeah," he says, holding her again and settling in.</p><p>"OK," she says as she starts singing the song. "You are my sunshine," she starts, and she doesn't even make it past the first lyric before he can't contain his feelings any longer and he starts bawling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok @jillianjames31</span></figure><p>He can't stop wailing, holding onto his mother as she explains to him: "See? This is why I don't wanna sing it 'cause you just cry."</p><p>This doesn't seem to be any consolation to the child, who continues to weep while looking at himself in the camera.</p><p>"Honey," she tells him, pulling the child closer to her chest.</p><p>"All done, all done," she tells him as the child composes himself. "Why do you ask me to sing that if you're gonna cry?"</p><p>"I don't know," he responds, still clearly emotional.</p><p>"OK, you just love the song, it just like makes, it just like touches your soul?"</p><p>"Yeah," the baby says, holding his nose as he fights back tears.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok @jillianjames31</span></figure><p>"It does," she says, agreeing with her child. "OK, hey you know I love you? Do you know I love you so much?"</p><p>"Yeah," her baby says.</p><p>"And I never wanna make you cry ... but you are my sunshine ... and you make me very happy when skies are gray."</p><p>"Mhmm," the baby says while looking into the camera.</p><p>Numerous folks who responded to the video couldn't help but laugh and also sympathize with the child, like this one person who remarked: "To be fair, 'You Are My Sunshine' makes me cry too."</p><p>Someone else said that they could understand where the baby was coming from: "He just needed a soundtrack for his little crying sesh."</p><p>But there was someone else who offered up a practical explanation as to why this track appears to trigger this response in folks: "I went to a children‚Äôs music class and the teacher told us that 'You Are My Sunshine' contains 'sad notes' so this is actually a common response from a lot of children to this song! Such a sweetie."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok @jillianjames31</span></figure><p>So maybe Jillian's kid is just picking up whatever the composer of "You Are My Sunshine" was putting down?</p><p>What songs make you blubber like a baby after just listening to a few lyrics?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66jxYycqaKdo2LGsMGMmqmeZZ2uerTBzayfoqaV</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joey-ahern-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joey Ahern - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
