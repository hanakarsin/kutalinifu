She later confirmed that she actually got fired. Her longtime co-star, Vicki Gunvalson, also departed from the series at the same time after having a "friend of" role in Season 14.</p><p>Both Vicki and Tamra are appearing on the Peacock original, <a href=#>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip Ex-Wives Club</a>, and the latter star is reportedly set to return to RHOC once again.</p><p>Is Tamra Judge coming back to RHOC?

She can't wait to get back in the mix on RHOC and see how she can shake up the dynamic," a source told the outlet.</p><p>Tamra's RHUGT co-star, Jill Zarin, spilled the beans about her return to RHOC in a since-disappeared Instagram story on July 16.</p><p>"And Tamra's coming back and my friend Vicki's not happy," Jill said.</p><p>In true Housewives fashion, Tamra responded to Jill with a bit of shade.

"The judge is back and drama is in session," she said, to which Cohen elaborated: "Ladies and gentleman, it's true — Tamra Judge is returning to the Real Housewives of Orange County."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Tamra Judge leave 'RHOC' after 11 seasons?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Tamra appeared on RHOC for 13 years before she was fired 2020. Although she was an original cast member and had several <a href=#>talked-about moments</a>, she focused on her family. At the time, her ex-husband, Simon Barney, had been diagnosed with throat cancer. In a February 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Andy's Jeff Lewis Live</a>, Tamra said that Simon's diagnosis played an integral role in her choice to exit RHOC.</p><p>"I was going to say I wasn't coming back at the reunion," she explained to Jeff. "I had just found out about Simon days before the reunion. I was a mess. I had been crying. I was crying — I don't want to cry now — I was crying in my dressing room, like, I can't go out there."</p><p>She continued: "And everyone's like, 'What's wrong?' And I'm like, 'I can't do this.’ I was going to tell everybody then that it was gonna be too hard for me to go back, you know, with Simon going through treatment and the kids. How are they gonna deal with it? At this time, he had just found out and hadn't started treatment. I didn't know what to expect. So [my husband Eddie]'s like, 'Yeah, just go do it.'"</p><p>Tamra has since been more candid about her departure, and she's been open about the fact that she was let go from the series.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tamra Judge (@tamrajudge)</a></p></figure><p>"I'm not cheap, Andy [Cohen], and that's why I got fired!" she said, per Us Weekly. "I'm not going to go into detail, but I'm going through some difficult times right now, and it was best for me to step away so I can deal with it on my own."</p><p>During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live in early 2022, Tamra joked with Andy about her firing.</p><p>"I love Heather. I asked for her return for many years," Tamra said on the show about Heather Dubrow's Season 16 return.<strong> "</strong>But, then you fired me and hired her."</p><p>On RHUGT, Tamra has also been honest about her firing — but, she'll soon be back on the show for good.</p><p>Before Tamra returns to RHOC, you can catch her on RHUGT Season 2. New episodes drop on Peacock on Thursdays. You can also stream past seasons of RHOC on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMCmqZplmqqxqLGMnKamoZ6ceqOtwqRkraddp7Wwrw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wendy-williams-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wendy Williams - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
