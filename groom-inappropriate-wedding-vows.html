Good grief!</p><p>Keep scrolling to see why TikTok did not find his whole charade funny.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok is dragging this groom's "inappropriate" and "disrespectful" wedding vows.</h2><p>Let's set the scene. In this video captured by wedding photographer Jonathan Pajak (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@lensculture on TikTok)</a>, a beautiful couple stands before the altar. It's now the groom's turn to recite his vows. He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and whispers to his bride, "You're screwed."</p><p>He then kicks off his vows by naming the two things he needs to be happy: a full belly and empty balls. And while his counterpart does satisfy the latter, he admits that she could use some cooking lessons.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lensculture href=#>@lensculture</a><p>You’re not gonna believe what he said in his vows! <a title=weddingvows href=#>#weddingvows</a> <a title=groomsvows href=#>#groomsvows</a> <a title=ohhno href=#>#ohhno</a> <a title=brideandgroom href=#>#brideandgroom</a> <a title=weddingbloopers href=#>#weddingbloopers</a> <a title=weddingceremony href=#>#weddingceremony</a> <a title=vowsgonewrong href=#>#vowsgonewrong</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Jonathan Pajak" href=#>♬ original sound - Jonathan Pajak</a></figure><p>Then he begins to say something almost sweet. “There is no one I could ever love more in this lifetime,” he reads, but unfortunately, he's not done yet. "Unless I ever get a chance to meet <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a>," he continues.</p><p>The groom then reflects on their future together. “Nothing’s better than gagging and headboard slamming,” he remarks, to which his mother, who is officiating the wedding, says, “Michael.”</p><p>Last but not least, he commends his bride on her decision to marry him and says, “You can choose whether tonight ends with being a toaster strudel or a Twinkie.”</p><p>The bride, who is laughing, is speechless. His mom then breaks the silence and teases that she is going to ground him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Tiktok</span></figure><p>It's safe to say that TikTok users were not amused by his words. One user pointed out that he only talked about his bride physically and not about how much he loved her. Another wrote: "If I was her, we'd no longer be getting married and I'd tell him to go find Margot Robbie so he can be rejected by two women in the same day."</p><p>"This was so disrespectful to say on your wedding," someone wrote.</p><p>"That's humiliating," added another commenter.</p><p>"Completely inappropriate in front of all her family. My dad would beat my fiancé's a--," wrote someone else.</p><p>Another comment said: "I could not even fathom my future person diminishing me in that way. Like not one single thing about who she is was said. It's disheartening. I hurt."</p><p>But apparently, the bride wasn't a fan of all these people bashing her husband and his vows. She commented on the video too. "So I'm the bride and no this isn't a red flag. We have been together for 10 years," she wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Some folks immediately sided with her, arguing that everyone writing mean comments about his vows doesn't even know the couple. Others asked her why she was defending him.</p><p>The bride <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to her own TikTok</a> to address the reaction, assuring that she's very much happy and in love and understands her husband's sense of humor.</p><p>"I loved his vows, I loved my vows, I loved our wedding day," she said. "His vows showed a piece of his personality which is the humor side, which is definitely Michael."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2Bwu8xmoKeZoKW%2FsLzRopitnV2ssqWwyKeeZq6frMA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./412856-nigerian-kid-beats-many-his-community-chess-game-wins-trophy-despite-having-cerebral-palsy-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youngster Suffering from Cerebral Palsy Beats Colleagues in Chess Game, Becomes Champion">&larr;
