Grant and his insanity creative videos helped to inspire me in all kinds of ways. Most of my projects own thanks to him in some way. My all-time favourite tutorial (and first project) was the backyard foundry. From there I have been building a 3,000,000 BTU’s Steel forge for blacksmithing. Soon I hope to have it fully complete. When I’m home next, I’ll do a post showcasing all the projects I have built from his videos. I’ll miss you.

R.I.P people who watched you when you were in the videos will miss you, said knightowl342.Grant was an inspiration to me. I started watching king of random a while back and love the experiments and projects he did. When he gave up making videos to spend time with his family, I felt proud of him for making that decision. I don't know if Grant's family will read this, but if you are, He was an amazing man. Though I didn't know him personally, through his videos, I feel like I did. I'm extremely sorry for your loss and am praying for you. We need more men like him to be inspirations in our world, said grnarrow18.Grant. You didn’t deserve this. You have a family. Many friends. And you are such a kind caring person. You are my childhood YouTuber and inspiration. Why does it have to be you. I really can’t stop crying about this but I hope you have a great life in heaven. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a121a9e6ba275759.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Malik from House of Payne?
