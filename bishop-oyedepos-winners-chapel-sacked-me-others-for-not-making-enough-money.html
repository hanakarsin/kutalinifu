I tried my possible best to make sure I win souls for Christ but unfortunately, on the 1st of July, I received a call that the state pastor wants to see me, so I thought I was the only one. I was surprised, so I went to his office.</p><p>“When I got there, I saw other pastors too, over 40 of them, so I joined them. A few minutes later, we were issued a letter. I opened the content of the letter to see what was there and I saw that it was a sack letter.</p><p>“The content of the letter says ‘Consequent upon the recent performance review which revealed that your church growth index falls below expectation. Please be informed that your service as the pastor in charge is no longer required in this commission with immediate effect. You are to vacate your official accommodation and hand over all properties including the official ID card to the area pastor before departure.</p><p>“So I called the management the next day to know what happened since I wasn’t involved in any dubious activity or evil act. I was told by the management was that the church doesn’t operate at a loss, they also told me the total income that is being generated from my station should be able to cater for my welfare and accommodation, so as a result of low income, I’m hereby dismissed.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/winners-chapel.jpg alt width=500 height=739 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BxZpuho528sXnOspydnaCkwG7DyKelnqqjYrCprc%2Beo2arkZi4prCMppxmp6SdsrO%2FjJ%2Bmq2WepMFuucCkoKefXZq7sMHGoWSmp56axnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-dss-arrests-efcc-chairman-ibrahim-magu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DSS 'Arrests' EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu">&larr;
