But his time spent in the public eye only seemed to tarnish his professional reputation as he became embroiled in a number of heated <a href=#>medical controversies</a>.</p><p>And as of April 30, it appears that Columbia University had quietly cut ties with him. Strangely enough, then something else weird happened. People were getting text messages that said that he had been shot and died. Was there any truth to this? Spoiler alert: No, Dr. Oz is alive and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently active on Twitte</a>r. But keep scrolling as we get to the bottom of this.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dr. Oz became part of a text-message death hoax.</h2><p>On April 30, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> reported that Columbia University had quietly scrubbed Dr. Oz from its website. The Ivy League school had removed his personal pages, which noted the positions he had held at the school, such as Vice Chair of Surgery and Director of Integrated Medicine. However, Dr. Oz, who has worked as a professor at the Department of Surgery at Columbia University since 2001, appears to still be listed in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">surgery faculty directory.</a></p><p>This abrupt move came after years of public <a href=#>criticism regarding his medical advice</a>. Not to mention, his candidacy may have also played a role in the school's decision to delete him from most of its website.</p><p>Shortly after Dr. Oz was stripped of his prestige at Columbia, people apparently began receiving texts that he had been shot and passed away. Some folks took to Twitter to share this wild news.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dr Oz dropped by Columbia amid pro-Trump Republican Senate run – report<br>‘He’s been a huge danger to public health,’ says prominent medical ethicist Dr Arthur Caplan.
