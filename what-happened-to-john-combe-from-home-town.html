It's just a place where I can come and relax and enjoy life," John said on his episode of Home Town. "Money is not a problem for me — the sky's the limit."</p><p>The home was also one of the largest properties Ben and Erin had ever tackled. It featured 3,000 square feet, three bedrooms, and three and a half bedrooms, and was listed at $199,000.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: HGTV/YouTube</span></figure><p>Viewers fell in love with John's sense of humor and passion for life over the course of the episode.
