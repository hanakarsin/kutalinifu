While snacks are definitely going to be available, folks should expect to eat a full meal before they head on over to her crib for the hour and a half long affair.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok |@rachonlife</span></figure><p>On top of not serving a meal, she's "not doing games" nor is she "doing anything really." The party "vibes" she's going for are from the '90s she says: there's going to be a ball pit, some toys for the kids to play with, and a trampoline up outside for kiddos to hop around on.</p><p>She also stated that she is "not spending money on this," while going on to remark, "And I am an excessive shopper like I...this headband costs $75 okay?" she says, pointing to the article of clothing on her head. "I'm not spending money on this. Like I spent money to get invitations printed and that's it."</p><p>"It's not going to be expensive," she reiterates in the video before writing to folks that she "specifically" asked folks to not bring gifts to the house. "We're doing a Harry Potter themed birthday party for her, her name is Hazel Paige so HP...I'm a big Harry Potter nerd, like it's a whole thing," she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok |@rachonlife</span></figure><p>She went on to detail the Potter-themed verbiage in which she detailed to party guests that they shouldn't be providing her child with any gifts when they attend this birthday.</p><p>Instead, she wrote, "If you feel inclined to bring something consider $5 because we're trying to remodel, re-do our backyard, we need to re-sod...our backyard is a trainwreck. Bring us five bucks to help us re-do our backyard that's what we're asking, but she does not need anything," she says.</p><p>The mom continued, "And I am very picky I don't want you to buy s--- for my kids."</p><p>Another rule for her daughter's first birthday party? No liquor or beer: "Also we're not serving alcohol I know it's pretty normal to serve booze at kid's birthday parties these days, like we did it our son's first birthday party and second birthday party, we had a freaking Taco Bar and margaritas," she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok |@rachonlife</span></figure><p>But this isn't the case for her daughter's first b-day. Rachel briefly considers getting a bottle of champagne for the party but ultimately rules against it, stating that her and her husband don't drink but they get booze for other people.</p><p>Another no-no for her daughter's party? No cake because "it is...9:30 in the morning."</p><p>She said that instead of a big cake, she's going to make "little coffee cakes and decorate them to look like mandrakes...because Harry Potter," she says into the camera after picking up her crying daughter, who immediately stops after her Mama picked her up.</p><p>There were some folks who agreed with her assessment of parties, stating that she has no problem going all out for her kids once they get older and that throwing large-scale engagements early on was kind of pointless as they aren't going to remember it. Kind of like taking an infant to <a href=#>Disney World</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok |@rachonlife</span></figure><p>But there were also those who said they'd otherwise feel "guilty" if they went all out for one child but didn't do the same for another.</p><p>What do you think? Are Rachel's rules for the party a little too hardlined? Or is it better for her to save her party budget ($75 headbands not included) for her kids when they're older?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyuecCsoqxlkp6%2FtbTDmrBmqJGnwbp5xq6crKyjYrqwusSy</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./362359-mwanamziki-abenny-jachinga-azikwa-usiku-wa-manane-kuepuka-fujo-za-waombolezaji-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mwanamziki Abenny Jachinga azikwa usiku wa manane kuepuka fujo za waombolezaji">&larr;
