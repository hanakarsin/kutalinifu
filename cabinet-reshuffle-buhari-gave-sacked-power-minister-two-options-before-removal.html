His sugar level had gone up. Maybe it had been long he had eight hours sleep.</p><p>“And the doctor yesterday had to bring down the sugar level.</p><p>“So, if you go to his house now in Maitama, you will see him there.</p><p>“Yesterday, I insisted he should grant interview, he granted Hausa service interview.</p><p>“So there was nothing like collapse. He heard about his removal before everyone else. At least, the President honoured him with that prior information.</p><p>“The President even gave him the option whether he would attend the Federal Executive Council meeting that day or not so that he would make the announcement after the meeting. He said he would not attend. These are the facts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49tZpyZkp67psCMq5ysoKWbs62xjJusoZminnqordWeZKyZk6CypXnPqK6eql2itq%2B10q2cq2WkrLxuu8%2BtoKimo2KvprLOq5xmqpWivLety2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./411683-e-sir-trio-mio-netizens-debate-who-best-rapper-is-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="E-Sir or Trio Mio?
