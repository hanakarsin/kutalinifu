This quote also teaches us that challenges and controversy often bring out people’s true nature.</p>Never, never be afraid to do what’s right, especially if the well-being of a person or animal is at stake. Society’s punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6bdf21c2890523d1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Andy on Life Below Zero?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As an advocate for civil rights, Martin Luther was looking out for the best interest of the overlooked in society. This quote reminds us that we have a moral obligation to help other people as well as animals. This is one of those Martin Luther King Jr quotes on leadership meant to inspire us to help others regardless of the consequences.</p>Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality.<p class=align-left>As a community, whatever affects one person affects all of us. This quote reminds us not to be selfish or look after our well-being. Instead, we should strive to help everyone else just as we help ourselves. By doing so, we not only elevate ourselves but the whole community as well.</p>We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to mankind.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c39e4b47c7b3dc41.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charles Njonjo: 10 facts that will blow your mind</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is a simple yet profound quote that teaches us that the accurate measure of success is not wealth but rather how well we have served each other. Instead of striving to amass a lot of wealth, we should strive to help each other.</p>The limitation of riots, moral questions aside, is that they cannot win and their participants know it. Hence, rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites defeat. It involves an emotional catharsis, but a sense of futility must follow it.<p class=align-left>Gandhi's peaceful protests heavily inspired Martin Luther King. Through this quote, he reminds us that rioting only invites defeat. For us to achieve anything we must demand it firmly but peacefully. This is the only way that we can make genuine progress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2b032a20cfd37424.jpeg>Those who are not looking for happiness are the most likely to find it because those who are searching forget that the surest way to be happy is to seek happiness for others.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fd17415ef49388bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 top best trending Joseph Hill Culture songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The only way that we can indeed be happy is by helping others to achieve happiness.

A soul generated by love.<p class=align-left>As a charismatic leader, Martin Luther persuaded leaders to serve the people instead of viewing leadership as a chance to gain selfishly.

There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think.<p class=align-left>This quote reminds us to embrace free thinking instead of settling for the easiest solution. Several of society’s problems are born out of our need for quick fixes and fast solutions. This quote teaches us to think and question everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6bdf21c2890523d1.jpeg>An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.<p class=align-left>Dr King was not only an advocate for the equality of African Americans, and he fought for all people regardless of race.

Through this quote, we are reminded that any work that uplifts the society is dignified and respectable.</p>We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right.<p class=align-left>This quote reminds us to always value time and use it wisely. This quote also reminds us that it is still the right time to do the right thing.</p>Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals.<p class=align-left>This quote teaches us that instead of viewing science and religion as being on opposite ends of the spectrum, these two are compatible. Science and religion go hand in hand as they are just different sides of the same coin.</p>The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.<p class=align-left>Through this quote, we are reminded that we have an obligation to speak out against injustices. It is immoral to sit by idly as people in our society are oppressed. We should rise up in unity against any injustices.</p>Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.<p class=align-left>This quote discourages us against viewing other people’s suffering as separate from our own. When an injustice occurs anywhere, it affects us all regardless of location.</p>Capitalism does not permit a smooth flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system.<p class=align-left>Capitalism is often viewed as an economic system designed to keep the rich, rich and the poor, poor. Although many people consider capitalism to be better than communism, the fact is both systems are equally evil. In this quote, Martin Luther inspires us to rise above this system that was designed by the greedy for the greedy.</p>Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.<p class=align-left>This quote reminds us that in the quest for freedom, we will need to demand it firmly and fiercely from the oppressor. The oppressed will have to raise their voice in unity and pursue their liberty relentlessly until they achieve.</p>Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality.<p class=align-left>Martin Luther King was a great advocate for communal living. Through this quote, he teaches us to view other people's suffering as our own and do our best to help each other.</p>Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle. And so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom. A man can't ride you unless your end is bent.<p class=align-left>This quote reminds us that to achieve the change we wish to see, we must be ready to fight for it. This quote also teaches us that the oppressed can only be oppressed if they lie down and allow the oppressor to walk all over them.</p>Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of men and is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them and the social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting burial.<p class=align-left>As a religious leader himself, Martin Luther firmly believed that all religions and believers should be men of action. This quote teaches us that a religion that is not concerned with the struggles of its congregants is not a religion worth following.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c39e4b47c7b3dc41.jpeg>Every man lives in two realms: the internal and the external. The internal is that realm of spiritual ends expressed in art, literature, morals, and religion. The external is that complex of devices, techniques, mechanisms, and instrumentalities by means of which we live.<p class=align-left>This quote teaches us to view life from two perspectives; the internal and external realm.</p>Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars - must be broken, or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.<p class=align-left>Dr King urged his fellow African Americans against hating their oppressors. He was a firm believer of loving your enemies despite what they had done. This quote teaches us that we should be tolerant and love each other as this is the only way that we can repair the community.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Bible verses about death</strong></p>We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the positive affirmation of peace.<p class=align-left>Through this quote, Martin Luther King teaches us that it is not enough to just merely stop wars. Instead, we should go a step further and advocate for peace in the wake of war.</p><h2>Top 3 Martin Luther King Jr. quotes on leadership.</h2>A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a moulder of consensus.<p class=align-left>Martin Luther King was a genuine and gifted leader. Through this quote, he teaches leaders that a true leader moulds the opinion of his followers. A true leader will guide his people to make the right decision. A true leader will also teach his people the right path to follow by following it himself it.</p>Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?<p class=align-left>Martin Luther believed that leadership was only the opportunity to serve others. Through this quote, he reminds leaders that they should use their position to serve the public humbly. Through this quote, we learn that the most important question is not what we gain but rather what we do for others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs1c9h47uo5ju.jpeg>Whatever your life's work is, do it well. A man should do his job so well that the living, the dead, and the unborn could do it no better.<p class=align-left>This quote teaches us that in whatever we do, we should put in our best.

As a leader, we must serve others diligently and wholeheartedly in a way that no one else can do it better than we have.</p><p class=align-left>Martin Luther King was an inspirational leader who laid the foundation for several other leaders to step up and lead the African American community.
