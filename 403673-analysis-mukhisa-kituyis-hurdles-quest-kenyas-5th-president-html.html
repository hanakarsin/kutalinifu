It is harder now that two are working together to consolidate the Luhya vote," said political analyst Nyukuri Barasa.<p class=align-left>Javan Karani, a communication strategist, noted Mukhisa can only move masses in Western region if gets the endorsement of ODM leader <a href=#>Raila Odinga</a> or President Uhuru Kenya or both.</p>"The reason why Mudavadi and Wetang'ula are working together is because they want to lock Raila out of Western. But remember this, although people are tired of Raila, they have not given up on him, so if he comes with someone like Mukhisa together with Oparanya then he can cause trouble, especially if Mukhisa is the candidate," said Karani.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b04d145906c5a00a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Section of Luhya elders endorse Musalia Mudavadi's 2022 presidential bid</span></p></a><h2>Detached from the people</h2><p class=align-left>Mukhisa was elected the MP for the larger Kimilili constituency in 1992 and was re-elected in 1997 and 2002.</p><p class=align-left>He lost the seat to Eseli Simiyu in 2007 in a hotly contested election.

His only weakness is that he has been detached from the people for too long. "He is returning to the political scene after losing the last two elections he participated in, that in 2007 and 2013. Now he is going for presidency, what does that tell you? He is locally starting from a negative and nationally moving into unchartered waters," argued Karani.<p class=align-left>Political analyst Javan Bigambo opined the former UNCTAD boss lacks the zeal, passion and energy to run a presidential campaign.</p><p class=align-left>He suggested a gubernatorial or senatorial bid would have been an equal match to his low-energy presidential campaign launch.</p>"At the risk of appearing banefully skeptical of his ambition, cognisant of his low-energy press conference today, I opine that Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi should serve as a Governor or Senator for now, then later, raise his sights to contest the presidency," said Bigambo via his Twitter handle.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f26b78d4f5267b56.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alfred Mutua sneers at Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetang'ula unity: "They part of our problems"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During an interview with <a href=#>KTN News</a> hours after announcing his presidential bid, the former Kimilili lawmaker acknowledged the challenge of being away from the people for long but promised to work on a plan to change the perception.</p>"I have not had an opportunity to talk to the people directly because as the secretary general of UNCTAD you only deal with governments and not people.
